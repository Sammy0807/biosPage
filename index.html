                        <div class="collapsible-body"><span style="text-align: justify !important;">I have been married for 6 years and I am a mother of three boys. I am also a speaker for human trafficking. I have been speaking about human trafficking for over a year and a half. My mission is to help people who are struggling in human trafficking and to help others become aware of  what human trafficking is. In 2012, I became a victim of human trafficking. After a couple of weeks, I was miraculously saved by God and I survived human trafficking. Now, with God's help, I am able to go out and share my story with others so that they will be informed about what modern day slavery is.</span></div>

                        <div class="collapsible-header">Ms. Cynthia Aulds. Director-Coalition to Combat Human Trafficking-Texas (CCHT)</div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><span style="text-align: justify !important;"><p> Cynthia Aulds is the Director of the Coalition to Combat Human Trafficking in Texas. Prior to her current role, Cynthia spent 21 years in the Healthcare field as a Registered Respiratory Therapist, a Clinical Specialist at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston and as Director of Cardiopulmonary Services at Hill Country Memorial Hospital in Fredericksburg, Texas.  During this time, she authored a chapter in the Collegiate textbook Perinatal and Pediatric Respiratory Care.  </p>

                            <p>      Cynthia transitioned into the position of Part-time Missions Minister at Sugar Land Baptist Church (outside Houston) while continuing to work as a Respiratory Therapist in 2009, until taking on the role Full-time in 2013. While in this Ministerial role, she was a member of the initial core group who started the Coalition to Combat Human Trafficking (founded in Laredo, Texas in 2015).</p>
                            
                            <p> In Cynthia’s Words: My work as Missions Minister involved anti-human trafficking efforts in Houston. I grew up in Houston, have lived the majority of my life there, and had no idea human trafficking existed, much less to the extent that it does. The more I learned, and the more I saw how prevalent trafficking is throughout Texas, from the smallest of towns to the largest metropolitan areas, the more I felt my passion changing to focusing my efforts on bringing awareness and education to others to help combat this horrific industry.</p>
                            
                            <p>Cynthia followed that passion and accepted the position as Director for The Coalition to Combat Human Trafficking-Texas in March of 2018.  Cynthia received her Associate of Arts Degree from Houston Community College and her Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Therapy from the University of Texas Health Science Center-Houston. She was ordained for ministry by Sugar Land Baptist Church, Sugar Land, Texas.</p></span></div>
